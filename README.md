**Definition/Overview:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages are contemporary programming languages based around the principle of creating objects as instances of classes. A class is similar to a blueprint that contains instructions for variables and methods that an object will have assigned to it (defining such characteristics as the object's behavior, identity, and state). If you are new one or more of these concepts, they will be discussed later in this guide!

Four concepts that unite OOP languages (and will be discussed in-depth in this guide) include:  
  
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism (you will notice some similarities between this concept and inheritance!)
