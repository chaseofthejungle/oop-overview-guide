# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Overview Guide
**Definition/Overview:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages are contemporary programming languages based around the principle of creating objects as instances of classes. A class is similar to a blueprint (or a template) that contains instructions for variables and methods that an object will have assigned to it (defining such characteristics as the object's behavior, identity, and state). If you are new one or more of these concepts, they will be discussed later in this guide!

Four object attributes that unite OOP languages (and will be discussed in-depth in this guide) include:  
  
* **Abstraction**
  + This permits objects to have *hidden details*.
    - Classes can be modeled based on immediately necessary/relevant code, with the program's inner workings/complexities remaining hidden.
* **Encapsulation**
  + This permits objects to have *hidden data*.
    - Hidden data can be restricted to a class and its particular methods and variables.
* **Inheritance**
  + This is when a class shares behavior and structure that were defined by/in another class.
    - Inheritance is used for *creating new classes* with these shared characteristics.
* **Polymorphism**
  + As the name suggests, 'multiple forms' are implied: a subclass's structure and behavior are defined by what was declared in its superclass (or 'main' class).
    - Polymorphism is used to *have objects considered as if they were derived from another, common class*.
